#   0: nothing particularly interesting whatsoever, or just a dreadful misfire.
#      I'd probably prefer that this not exist
#   3: interesting/funny, though perhaps flawed
#   4: pretty good and/or very interesting
#   5: recommended listening without reservation. I think this is actually 'good'
