- caption: ['FRED:', 'Look at that. I''ve ruined another choice cut of sirloin steak.
      My boss will soon fire me. (Pause) Folks at home, do you understand what I''m
      talking about? It seems like every day, if I''m not waiting for hours while
      a box of ham thaws, I''m reducing all my food into miniature charcoal briquettes.
      And boy oh boy, my boss is expecting me, and a juicy sirloin steak, in the other
      room right now.', 'LOUIS:', (Walking on stage)And that is one stomach you really
      don't want to make angry. (Audience applauds), 'FRED:', 'Why, it''s Louis Harrison,
      chef of a highly mentionable restaurant!(Shakes hands) (More applause)', 'LOUIS:',
    'Hello, Fred. (Pause) Fred, there is an important reason why I came here. I need
      to alert the public about a revolutionary new invention.', 'FRED:', That you
      invented., 'LOUIS:', That I invented. It's called (short pause) &ldquo;The Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;,
    'FRED:', '&ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;? Sounds confusing.', 'LOUIS:', 'Well,
      it isn''t. In fact, it''s so <u>incredibly easy</u> to cook with, it even has
      the patented &ldquo;Incredo-Easy&trade;&rdquo; cooking system.', 'FRED:', 'Wow!
      That <u>does</u> sound easy. (Short pause) But how does it work?', 'LOUIS:',
    'To understand my &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;, you must first understand
      how normal ovens work. They pump great amounts of heat into your food, constantly
      removing valuable flavor, and therefore, exponentially increasing the chance
      of consumer dissatisfaction. In essence, this is no different than an oven manufacturer
      breaking into your home, stealing your money, and spitting in your face.', 'FRED:',
    That's not good., 'LOUIS:', 'It certainly isn''t. My &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;,
      however, <u>harnesses the power of suction</u>.', 'FRED:', 'Woah. Wait. Hold
      on, buddy. The power of suction?', 'LOUIS:', Precisely. Suction is defined as
      &rdquo;1. Production of a partial vacuum so that external prsessure forces fluid
      in or causes something to adhere to a surface. 2. A sucking.&rdquo;, 'FRED:',
    'So Louis, you''re saying that your &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; <u>harnesses</u>
      this <u>suction</u> to <u>cook</u>.', 'LOUIS:', Exactly. (Audience applauds),
    'FRED:', '(Pause) You know, Louis, I now understand how the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;
      can <u>cook</u>, but can it cook <u>food</u> in a realistic environment, such
      as this soundstage?', 'LOUIS:', 'Let''s find out. (Pause) (Music plays in background,
      then stops) Fred, would you believe that I could cook a steak in the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;?',
    'FRED:', 'A <u>sirloin</u> steak?', 'LOUIS:', 'Yes, I can cook a steak, and it
      is &ldquo;Incredo-Easy&trade;&rdquo; to do so. You just open up the safety hatch,
      (opens safety hatch) move the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; kabob accessory
      to a different location, (moves the accessory) and just drop in the steak while
      holding in the &ldquo;Condense&rdquo; button. (Drops steak, holds in button)
      All you have left to do is pour in 3 cups of flour in the &ldquo;Incredo-Easy&trade;&rdquo;
      sifting window, and then flip switch five. (Pause) This steak should be ready
      to eat in 15 minutes. (Applause)', 'FRED:', Now <u>that</u> is easy., 'LOUIS:',
    'Make that &ldquo;Incredo-Easy&trade;&rdquo;! (Both men laugh, audience applauds)',
    'FRED:', 'Louis, I would suppose that working as chef in a very mentionable restaurant
      would inspire you to create your own special dishes.', 'LOUIS:', 'Yes, it has.',
    'FRED:', 'And I also suppose that holding these recipes to yourself, shielding
      them from the general public, has made you feel like a real S.O.B.', 'LOUIS:',
    You are correct on that one., 'FRED:', 'I would then suppose that in a way to
      salvage your tattered, soiled soul, you would package a selection of these recipes
      with your &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; ', 'LOUIS:', 'Bingo. Each and
      every &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; comes with ten full-color recipe cards,
      containing my very favorites, such as my &ldquo;Lunchin'' Tex-Mex Snack Crackers.
      (Audience applauds)', 'FRED:', 'And you can make this meal with only the ingredients
      listed on the card?', 'LOUIS:', 'That''s the idea of a recipe. (Short pause)
      To make this dish, just open your &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;, (walks
      to second machine, further down counter) and add 1 bag of uncooked bacon, 3
      eggs, with shells, and one large packet of gelatin mix. (Adds ingredients)',
    'FRED:', Wow., 'LOUIS:', 'And then, just after using two of the three &ldquo;Incredo-Easy&trade;&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Clamp-Rods&rdquo; to secure the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; lid,
      flip switches 2, 6, and 8. (Pause) These Tex-Mex snack crackers should be ready
      in seven minutes. (Applause)', 'FRED:', Now <u>that</u> is easy., 'LOUIS:',
    'Make that &ldquo;Incredo-Easy&trade;&rdquo;! (Both men laugh, audience applauds)',
    'FRED:', 'Louis, watching you pour the gelatin mix into the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;
      reminded me of the dissolving &ldquo;gelatin crystals&rdquo; of my income, fading
      away into the &ldquo;bacon-fat&rdquo; of everyday expenses.', 'LOUIS:', Nice
      metaphor., 'FRED:', 'Yes, it is. (Pause) My question is, Louis, will the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;
      break the bank? Or merely distort it in a way that will please me and my family?',
    'LOUIS:', 'Well, Fred, if you go into a normal department store, such as a McSweeny''s
      or a Govgebot Ltd, you could buy one of my &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;s&rdquo;
      for 800 dollars. And oh boy, it''s worth it.', 'FRED:', 'Yes, it is.', 'LOUIS:',
    'Yes, it is.', 'FRED:', 'Yes, it is.', 'LOUIS:', (Long pause), 'FRED:', 'Yes,
      it is.', 'LOUIS:', '&hellip;But the people who watch this infomercial deserve
      better. (Applause)', 'LOUIS:', 'For today only, in a special television deal,
      you can get my &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; for&hellip;870 dollars. (Mild
      applause)', 'FRED:', 'Louis, that''s a good deal&hellip;but I think you can

      louder than before)', 'FRED:', '(Waits for applause to end) Louis, I think that
      the &ldquo;Lunchin'' Tex-Mex Snack Crackers&rdquo; are ready.', 'LOUIS:', 'They
      are. (Short pause) Would you care to try one?', 'FRED:', 'Certainly. (Louis
      puts spatula into cooker, then pulls out piece with his hand) (Fred eats piece)
      Wow. &hellip;Wow. The taste is so authentic&hellip; I could swear that I am
      standing on a piece of land that is either in Texas or Mexico. Incredible. (Applause)',
    'LOUIS:', 'I can tell that you already have developed quite a liking to the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;
      What do you think other people from across the country think of it?', 'FRED:',
    'Well, unless they''re some sort of child molester, I would <u>guarantee</u> that
      they would love the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;', 'LOUIS:', Let's watch
      some testimonials to find out., '(Testimonial one: Leo Freeman. Scranton, Pennsylvania.)<br/>LEO:',
    'I enjoy the rich, savory tastes of many food products. The &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;

      Louis Harrison is ignoring him.)<br/><br/>LOUIS:', 'Is there a problem, Fred?',
    'FRED:', '(Quickly comes to attention, with normal voice) Well, Louis, I was just
      flooded with traumatic memories from my childhood. They crush me, Louis. It
      simply crushes me.', 'LOUIS:', 'Could you get into detail about it, Fred?',
    'FRED:', 'Well, I can''t get into detail about it, but I''ll say that nothing
      could save me now&hellip; except a succulent young lobster, with cream sauce.',
    'LOUIS:', '(Puts hand to ear) Do you hear that, Fred?', 'FRED:', 'The unending
      silence of my unending death?', 'LOUIS:', No! It's the call of the &rdquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;!
      (Music starts) (Music stops), 'LOUIS:', 'What would you say if I told you that
      you can boil a lobster in the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; without wasting
      quarts and quarts of messy, expensive water?', 'FRED:', I would whimper from
      under the blanket of suffering that smothers me so., 'LOUIS:', 'No, it is true!
      Just add one lobster to 12 cups of salt, inside the &rdquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;
      (Pause) It boils in only nine minutes! (Applause)', 'FRED:', (Softly) The crushes
      is begin to stopping! (Pause) (Normally) Please go on., 'LOUIS:', 'And listen
      to this: when boiling your lobster in your &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;,
      a yellow discharge will slowly leak from around the &ldquo;Incredo-Easy&trade;&rdquo;
      safety latch. (Short pause) Our attorneys have advised us that we can technically
      refer to this as &ldquo;cream sauce&rdquo;. (Applause)', 'FRED:', (Softly) The
      crushes stopping now moreful., 'LOUIS:', 'And Fred, would you care to try some
      lobster that I secretly prepared nine minutes ago? (Pulls out &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;,
      readies plate, puts garnish on dish)', 'FRED:', '(Eats bite) (Normally) You
      know, Louis&hellip; this has completely cured me of my trauma. (Applause) (Both
      men laugh) (Louder applause)', 'LOUIS:', 'Fred, I believe that you now hold
      a deep respect for the &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; You love it more
      than you love your wife, children, mother, and father. (Pause) In fact, you
      would kill them all in order to get your hands on a &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo;',
    'FRED:', Yes. I would. I'm sorry I've ever doubted you., 'LOUIS:', I accept your
      apology. (Light applause), 'FRED:', It's certainly been one wild trip tonight
      in the wonderful world of &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; (Pause) I guess
      that I have nothing left to do than go back to dinner with my boss., 'LOUIS:',
    'Aren''t you forgetting something?', 'FRED:', '(Extremely long pause) My sirloin
      steak! (Reaches into &ldquo;Superbo-Cooker&trade;&rdquo; on counter, pulls out
      steak, with cloud of flour) Now I''ve got my sirloin steak, (looks at watch)
      with seconds to spare! (Walks towards door, then turns around) Goodbye, Louis.
