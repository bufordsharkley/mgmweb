A Message for a Vagrant
</div>
I’m sorry, sir, vagrant,<br/>
But we’ve no room to let<br/>
Forgive!<br/>
(If you deem it wise)<br/>
But mind, kind sir,<br/>
That we don’t choose not, but CAN’T<br/>
Yes:<br/>
We’ve bought barrels<br/>
And barrels<br/>
Of brine<br/>
<br/>
The salesman came morn, with his brine-tastic offer<br/>
Yes!<br/>
Pickling, and pickling galore!<br/>
At just seven dollars apiece<br/>
(Per barrel)<br/>
We shant’d give scorn<br/>
No! Bought us, did, eighty-three!<br/>
<br/>
Storage came tricky:<br/>
Barrels huge, house less so<br/>
But cram!<br/>
And lug!<br/>
‘Til each room barreled be<br/>
Yes, each bedroom, parlor and den<br/>
<br/>
Now think of the danger that face each of we:<br/>
I, my wife, and the kids<br/>
Chance o’ pickling death, big threat already is,<br/>
Would worsen<br/>
With one vagrant in<br/>
