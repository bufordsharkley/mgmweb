If you run across some Howards<br/>
Ask them how, now, they may be.<br/>
They'll say "Howard we all doing?"<br/>
We feel funky; we feel free."<br/>
<br/>
Give a daunting task to Howards,<br/>
To you shock, now, they'll agree.<br/>
They'll say "Howard we to do it?<br/>
Oh, no, just you wait and see!"<br/>
