##You need not bite a spider

You need not bite a spider,
In truly any case
For there is no meat inside her,
And she hasn’t any face

Not a face to wince or grimace,
’T’least, nor any meat said fit to sate,
And what reasons are ’t’lure in us
Save these: Sustenance and Hate?

Not that hate is worthy little--
’Tis true ’tis grand, if ’xcist a cause!
But beware wee size, for it’ll
Jam ’twixt teeth; and not ’twixt jaws

If there is but one thing for these lines to didact,
It’s that one must not and should not bite an arach
