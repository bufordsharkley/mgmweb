##Anti-Murder Poem

It says quite clearly: "Thou Shalt Not Kill"
Then why do you murder, people, c'mon.
Keep up this killing,
You know what'll happen:
The dinosaur's gonna get you.

I mean, to take out a gun? And shoot someone else?
That's not cool.
You'll probably regret it,
When not before long:
The dinosaur's gonna get you.

BRIDGE:
Dinosaur, dinosaur
Dino, dino, dino, dino, dino, dino-saur.

When it comes down to killing your brethren,
I say "What the hey!" Know what I mean?
Keep up this killing,
You know what'll happen:
The dinosaur's gonna get you.
