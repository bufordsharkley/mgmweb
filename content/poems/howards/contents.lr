title:Official anthem of all Howards
---
body:If you run across some Howards  
Ask them how, now, they may be.  
They'll say "Howard we all doing?"  
We feel funky; we feel free."  

Give a daunting task to Howards,  
To you shock, now, they'll agree.  
They'll say "Howard we to do it?  
Oh, now, just you wait and see!"
